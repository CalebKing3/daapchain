AUDIENCE
	This white paper is intended for anyone interested in digital currency and the engines that drive them. If you do not know or care about what digital currency is, this white paper may not be for you. If you mine, own, facilitate or are simply interested in digital currency, this white paper is for you!

INTRODUCTION
	Since the invention of AARPANET in 1983, there has been an explosion of innovation in internet technology. These innovations could not have been fully realized before AARPANET, the World Wide Web or the Internet itself was created. Without doubt, one of these often under appreciated innovations is the SSL authentication handshake process that occurs with every secure internet communication request. These secure handshakes occur billions of times per second then afterwards, these datas are just left on the floor. We insist that these datas contain valuable information.

	In this document we will introduce the blockchain process called DAAP. We will show how the DAAP algorithm can be weilded to collect, compile and validate incredibly difficult to duplicate encrypted tokens. We will also show how applications provided by the world's leading blockchain ecosystem's can fit seemlessly around the DAPP model. Lastly, we will contextually analyze the protocol itself; including the ledger, wallet and percentage applications. Welcome.

PREMISE
	Why DAAP?
	DAAP data is important because the cellular interior of DAAP data can be verifed by a globally recognized Certificate Authority. The same authority that validates the billions of secure internet requests happening every second. This makes the data immutably resistant to tamper or duplication. These datas can be collected, compiled and crafted into a secure, fully verifiable tokens.

	We already have Bitcoin and others, why do we need yet another currency?
	We already have the wonderful United States of America, why do we need Switzerland? Any algorhitm that can fit seemslessly into the global blockchain ecosystem only serves to make the entire ecosystem as a whole that much stronger. Additionaly, when currencies abate, the diversity of multiple currencys allow for a greater percentage of survival until currencies rise again.

PROOFS

	DEFINITIONS
		SHAKE - Secure handshake authentication keys, encryted.
		DAAP - A daap is a collection of shakes which persist in the daapchain block chain.
		DAPPCHAIN - A daapchain is a blockchain for persisting ADDBLOCK and MODBLOCK transaction messages. 
		DAAPWALLET - A daapwallet is a local daapchain of ADDBLOCK and MODBLOCK transaction message.	

	ALGORITHM
		ah <!-- authenticated handshake -->
		A = 05 <!-- initial number of shakes to make a daap. -->
		S = 1.00314195 <!-- scale at which daap grow. -->
		D = A(ah) <!-- daap is a collection of A(authenticated handshakes). -->
		...
		A = S(D) <!-- number of shakes to make a daap increased. -->
		D = A(ah) <!-- daap is a collection of A(shakes) increased. -->
		...
		DC = D[ADDBLOCK|MODBLOCK] <!-- daapchain is a collection of daap creation and daap modification events. -->
		...
